# IMDb vs. Letterboxd: Comparative Analysis of Film Ratings

## Overview
This data analysis project examines the differences in film ratings between two major film review platforms: IMDb and Letterboxd. IMDb was founded in 1990 while Letterboxd was founded in 2011, and has seen a surge in its popularity since 2020. This suggests that the IMDb audience would be more broad and mainstream, and Letterboxd would attract a younger user base.

The goal of this project was to compare the two platforms by analyzing rating patterns using various film attributes (release year, genre, language, and box office performance).

## Technical Details
- **Analysis Tools:** PostgreSQL (for data storage, cleaning, and analysis)
- **Visualization:** Tableau (for creating visualizations and dashboards)

The Tableau dashboard for this project can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brandonancil/viz/IMDbvs_Letterboxd/Dashboard1).

## Questions
1. **Yearly Trends:** How do average ratings compare between IMDb and Letterboxd by release year?
2. **Box Office Success:** Do the highest grossing films receive different ratings across platforms?
3. **Genre Comparison:** Which genres show the largest rating disparities between platforms?
4. **Language Analysis:** Do foreign-language films show differing rating patterns compared to English-language films?

## Data Sources
- [**The Ultimate 1Million Movies Dataset (TMDB + IMDb)**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alanvourch/tmdb-movies-daily-updates)**:** A dataset from Kaggle that features films curated from The Movie Database (TMDB) along with their corresponding IMDb ratings. This dataset is updated daily.

## Analysis

### Data Cleaning & Matching Process
- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Removed duplicates and standardized data formats.
  - Used SQL for data cleaning and uploading datasets to a relational database.
  - Removed films not present in both datasets or with less than 100 ratings on IMDb.
  - Restructured table schemas optimize for analysis.

- **Data Matching:**
  - Performed fuzzy matching based on combinations of metadata to pair films across datasets.
      - For example, matching films with the same name, release year, and runtime.
  - Applied regular expressions to strip non-alphanumeric characters from movie titles to improve matches.
  - Used proximity matching for films with slight variations in runtime (¬±3 minutes) or release year (¬±1 year).
  - Successfully matched over **70,000 films** across both datasets for analysis.

### Box Office Success & Ratings Analysis
- Filtered films that grossed over **$100 million** (~1,300 films).
- Created a bar chart that analyzed average ratings based on:
  1. All movies overall
  2. Movies grossing over $100M
  3. Top 1,000 highest grossing films
  4. Top 100 highest grossing films
- Created another visualization that specifically looked at rating differences for each film that grossed over **$1 billion** (27 films).

  - Most common: **Drama (34,000 films)**, **Comedy (25,000 films)**.
  - Other popular genres: Action, Romance, Horror, Thriller (~10,000-12,000 entries each).
